# VSCode Scaffolder Extension

Do you want to make your life easier?

Do you want a little robot to do your work for you? :robot:

**Well you've come to the right place.** 

This VSCode Extension will give you a push in the right automation direction. By guiding you through setting up a scaffolding tool, you can then create a settings object to utilise it from the VSCode window, creating new code packages from the explorer.

## Development Progress

- [x] Initialise the project and create a readme
- [ ] Figure the rest out :)
